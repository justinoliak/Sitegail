GitHub Personal Access Token Setup Instructions

To fix the GitHub push issue, follow these steps to create and use a personal access token:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub.com and sign in
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Select "Settings"
   - Scroll down to "Developer settings" (at the bottom of the left sidebar)
   - Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"
   - Click "Generate new token" and then "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Website Push Token")
   - Set the expiration as desired
   - Check the "repo" scope to give full control of repositories
   - Click "Generate token"
   - IMPORTANT: Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!

2. Use the token for pushing to GitHub:
   - In your terminal, run the following commands:

   ```
   cd /Users/justinoliak/Documents/gail/Sitegail
   git push https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/justinoliak/Sitegail.git main
   ```

   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN with the token you just created.

This approach will avoid any interactive authentication prompts and should successfully push your changes to GitHub.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use a personal access token, you can try:

1. Using SSH keys for GitHub authentication
2. Using the GitHub Desktop application to push changes
3. Running `git push origin main` in Terminal (outside of Cursor) and entering your credentials when prompted
